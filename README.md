# British Airways Job Simulation on Forage

This repository contains my submission for the British Airways Data Science Job Simulation on Forage. The project covers the end-to-end data science workflow, starting from web scraping to data analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and building a prediction model for classification.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to simulate a real-world data science task for British Airways. The workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Web scraping to gather the required data.
2. **Data Analysis**: Employing NLP techniques to process and analyze textual data.
3. **Prediction Model**: Developing a classification model to predict specified outcomes based on the processed data.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Web Scraping
- Used Python's `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` libraries to extract data from the web.
- Cleaned and stored the scraped data for further analysis.

### 2. Data Analysis (NLP)
- Conducted text preprocessing, including:
  - Tokenization
  - Stopword removal
  - Lemmatization
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract insights from the text data.

### 3. Prediction Model (Classification)
- Utilized machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn` to build and evaluate classification models.
- Tested multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and selected the best-performing one based on metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: `BeautifulSoup`, `requests`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `nltk`

## Key Features
- Comprehensive data pipeline from scraping to prediction.
- NLP-based text analysis for actionable insights.
- Classification model with performance evaluation.


## Conclusion
This project highlights my ability to handle a complete data science workflow, demonstrating skills in data collection, processing, and machine learning. The British Airways Job Simulation provided valuable experience in solving real-world challenges in the aviation industry.
